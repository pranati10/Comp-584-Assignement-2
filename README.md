This project unfolds in two key phases, each contributing to a seamless audio analysis experience. In the first phase, a Dockerized Flask application is crafted, incorporating a sophisticated audio processing library. This robust backend exposes a Flask endpoint that gracefully handles audio files via a POST request. Users can submit their audio files for analysis, and the backend responds with detailed tempo-related insights. The data includes overall tempo, peak values, and other relevant metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of the audio's rhythmic characteristics.

In the second phase, a user-centric local web application is developed using Flask. This application acts as the frontend interface, streamlining user interaction with the Flask endpoint. Users can effortlessly fetch responses from the backend, and the application intelligently stores this data in a local data store. The hallmark of the application lies in its presentation layerâ€”a user-friendly table view that organizes and displays the tempo-related information. This intuitive display ensures users can easily navigate and understand the intricate details of the analyzed audio.

Enhancing the user experience, the application boasts an HTML-based export feature. Users can seamlessly export the tabular data to Microsoft Excel format, providing a convenient way to further analyze or share the tempo insights. The export feature leverages HTML's versatility, ensuring compatibility across different platforms while adhering to a widely accepted and accessible data format.

In essence, this project harmonizes cutting-edge audio processing capabilities with a locally hosted web application, making audio analysis accessible to users. Whether exploring musical compositions or conducting detailed tempo-related studies, this project aims to deliver a user-friendly and versatile solution. It invites exploration, contribution, and engagement, providing a platform for users to delve into the rhythmical intricacies of their audio content.
